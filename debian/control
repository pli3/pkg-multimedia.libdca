Description: decoding library for DTS Coherent Acoustics streams (development)
 libdca provides a low-level interface to decode audio frames encoded using
 DTS Coherent Acoustics. DTS Coherent Acoustics streams are commonly found
 on DVDs, DTS audio CDs and some radio broadcastings. libdca also provides
 downmixing and dynamic range compression for various output configurations.
 .
 This package contains the headers and static libraries used to build
 applications that use libdca.

Description: backward compatibility place-holder for libdca
 libdca provides a low-level interface to decode audio frames encoded using
 DTS Coherent Acoustics. DTS Coherent Acoustics streams are commonly found
 on DVDs, DTS audio CDs and some radio broadcastings. libdca also provides
 downmixing and dynamic range compression for various output configurations.
 .
 This package contains compatibility headers used to build applications
 that still use libdts.
